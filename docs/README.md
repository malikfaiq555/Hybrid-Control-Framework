**Abstract:**

> Recent studies have suggested ways to enhance user perception of remote workspaces and robot autonomy, often at the expense of system suitability and efficiency. This research introduces **Distributed Supervisory Control (DSC)**, leveraging Virtual Reality (VR) to intelligently distribute tasks between the robot and the human operator, minimizing shared autonomy conflicts. Using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) via Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3), DSC significantly enhances teleoperation efficiency, reducing task execution time and collision frequency, while lowering overall user task load as verified by real-time experiments and extensive user studies.
